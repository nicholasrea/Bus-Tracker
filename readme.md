#Bus Tracker

##Project
Here I was tasked with utilizing API, and asynchronus code to use a map library, and query data returned in the form of a JSON.  I then take that data and extrapolate  it to update a position for each of the busses listed.  

##Road Map for the future
I really need to clean up the javaScript, so that the markers refresh.  I would also like to get the default marker replaced with a graphic. 

##How to use
You can navigate to https://nicholasrea.github.io/Bus-Tracker/ for the demo, or fork and run the application for yourself.  I hope you enjoy my work
